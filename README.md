# SEAWARE (Semantic Aware View Prediction System)
Semantic-Aware View Prediction System (SEAWARE) is designed to improve the overall view prediction performance. We develop an approach where video semantic analysis is executed on the media server, and the analysis results are shared with clients via the Semantic Flow Descriptor (SFD) and View-Object State Machine (VOSM). SFD and VOSM become new descriptive additions of the Media Presentation Description (MPD) and Spatial Relation Description (SRD) to support 360- degree video streaming via the DASH framework.
